# MOOC Java Programming 1

My solutions to the University of Helsinki's MOOC Java Programming Course Part 1.  
Solutions provided are as of the year 2023 and should only be used for educational purposes  
and comparison with your own work. Feel free to ask questions, contribute, or post feedback  
via the issues tab of this repository. You can find more information on the course as well as
the official [MOOC exercises here].

Please note that as the course is no longer being actively monitored or proctored by the University,  
you are only required to complete all exercises and quizzes up to section 5, and only complete the quizzes for  
sections 6 and 7 to earn your certificate for Part 1.
